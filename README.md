This project was completed as part of the 'Programming of Microcontrollers' module at the University of York. It involved interfacing two hardware gamepads to a Raspberry Pi, to control a game of Pong.
Each controller had a variable resistor dial and two buttons. The game had to run entirely on the Raspberry Pi and the game's UI was drawn by sending escape sequences over a serial line to a terminal running on a PC.
